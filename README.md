# Test Scheduling App

Before intalling the project, make sure you have `nodeJS` version `v14.16.0` or higher.

### `Running the App`

Navigate to `/client` folder and do `yarn install` or `npm run install`.
Do it on `/server` directory too.

After installing, run the app (client and server) and you should be good to go.
